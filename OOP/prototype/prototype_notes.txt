In javascript, an obj can inherit properties of another obj.
The obj from where properties are inherited is called prototype. 
In short, objs can inherit properties from other objs - the prototypes.

Every obj in javascript has an internal property called [[Prototype]].

Javascript is a prototype-based language, meaning obj properties and methods 
can be shared through generalized objs that have the ability to be cloned and extended.

When it comes in inheritance, JavaScript has only 1 structure: objs.
