The Map obj is a simple key/value map.

Use maps over object when keys are unknown until run time, 
and when all keys are the same type and all values are the same type.

Use maps in case if there is a need to store primitive value as keys bcos
obj treats each key as a string whether it's a number value, boolean value 
or any other primitive value.

Use objs when there is logic that operates on individual elements.

========================================================================

The keys of an obj are Strings where they can be any value for a Map.

You can get the size of a Map easily while you have to manually keep track of 
size of an obj.

The iteration of maps is in insertion order of the elements

An obj has a prototype, so there are default keys in the map, ( this can be 
bypassed using map = Object.create(null))
